## Let's start

The challenge website had an input field to enter notes where we could write what we want.
First of all i tried to fuzz in order to see how the challenge would react , the first thing i noticed it was a csrf token and our notes in the post request,
i also noticed that the backend checks the submitted note. If we send a special character to escape the any strange element, such as <  , the server would sanitize with the  htmlspecialchars() PHP function, which should prevent XSS attempts on this field.

Fortunately during my test i also tried to put an email in the note field wich helped me to find a hidden feature.

I tought it was interesting bacuse maybe we could escape since the email address appears inside the href attribute of the HTML tag.
After i decided to read how "mailto" works from the rfc , and i found out there is a strange way to declare the email:
``` "\\\"it's\ ugly\\\""@example.org; ```
 It was a very good find , because it could allow to inject javascript between ``` "\\\"it's\ ugly\\\" ```  and ``` "@example.org; ```
  
the final payload was :
``` "\\\"traffik\prova\\\"\ onmouseover=alert('flag{THIS_IS_THE_FLAG}');//"@outlook.it  ```

The following payload breaks out of the attribute and adds an onmouseover event.

## CSRF Token bypass
The challenge had CSRF token(in this case hashed with MD5) built in. The page generates a token and stores it in a hidden form input.  That's a problem for our final POC because the server ensure that the form hasn’t been submitted by a malicious site thanks to this token , so we need to bypass it. 

First of all i tried to generate an empty csrf token and a csrf token of the same length as the original but nothing worked.
After a while i noticed that there was also a comment with a timestamp and it helped me a lot , because after a research i understood that the token was generated by taking the unix timestamp and hashandled it in md5 , that's not effective as a protection because is easy to predict the token.

So in order to finish the challenge i made a POC where i could send my xss payload inside the notes parameter with the post request thanks to ``` XMLHttpReques ``` ,  to bypass the csrf token i just took the date with ``` Date.now() ``` function in js and hashandled all in md5.
